***************************************************************************************************** 4th Artifical Life *********************************************************************************************************This package presents three programs that demonstrate some very interesting concepts: chaos in rules (Life), evolution (Animal Farm)and learning in neural networks (ChaseNet):1) 'LIFE', the famous AUTOMATIC BOARD GAME, that calculates	new populations with 3 rules. Produces interesting 'swerms'.2) 'ANIMAL FARM', a GENETIC cellular AUTOMATA algoritm, that 	demonstrates concepts like evolution and even biosystems.	Witness evolving fauna eating too much flora and disturbing balance.3) 'CHASENET', a small NEURAL NET that drives a very simplistic 	'virtual robotcar'. It uses 'hill climbing' to improve chasing an object. >> These three programs can be EXECUTED by dropping them on 'Forth' <<*The file Extended.4th is a small extension that is used by these files.*The Forth programming language is explained in short in the Manual  and all the commands are described in the Glossary (see below)***************************************************************************Animal FarmAnimal farm presents a small 'world' on the display,it is an 20*20 array, so that means a 400 places to stayfor the creatures that are going to live in that world.Each place receives some free energy (like from the SUN)and a creature on that place can collect that energy.Species & Energy:Time begins with just one member of the specie 'A'.The specie name is calculated from it's features:-defense force (D)-attack force (A)-speed  (S)Specie name: A+4*D+10*S  ->  0-25  ->  A-ZSo the higher the ASCI-code the more 'powerful' the specie!Of course having features costs energy (E):each calculation step: E -> E+SUN-(A+D+2S)Moving and Reproducing:When a specie CAN move, it moves randomly. But every place it decides to take over it has take conquer the creature that's already there.When his attack is more powerful than the defense of his opponenthe takes that place and the life and energy of his opponent (if not: v.v.)The same thing occurs when a creature decides to divide itself (energy is splitted). It's offspring (which might be mutated) has to conquer a place to live.Notice that after a while species occur which could not live without thelower species: a real bio system![Animal Farm concept: Mervyn@xs4all.nl 1995]***************************************************************************LifeLife explains what is does as it is executed[Life concept: Conway 1970]***************************************************************************ChaseNetChaseNet explains what it does as it is executed.PS: the values that are constantly changing are the factors that the0/1 at the inputs are multiplied with. The threshold is 10. So when aninput is high (1) and the factor is greater than 10, the next neuron is activated (just follow the lines on the screen).[ChaseNet concept: Mervyn@xs4all.nl 1995]*************************************************************************************************** FORTH Manual **************************************************************************************************************Creating your own clickable Mac applications is quite easy. Pocket Forth (by Chris Heilman) is a powerful tool to do just that. *Create your source code using your favorite word processor (plain text)*Drop the document on Pocket Forth Pocket Forth compiles the new word definitions and interprets direct commands in the document (e.g. 'run this program').*If the program is debugged and does the job fine, drop it onto a COPY of Forth, and make it a 'turnkey' by saving it into the 'standard library' (of that copy) and tell it to always start with that program. It then is a clickable application! (Forth is only 18K small, so who cares!)***************************************************************************FORTH PROGRAMMING in just 6 small steps<< This is NOT a manual that describes all the possibilities    of FORTH, it's meant to get you going. I learned FORTH during the     last14 days, so I can't tell you all the ins and outs, but I hope this     will prove to you that FORTH is simple,  but powerful!                  >>***************************************************************************1 THE STACKThe most important item to understand when using Forth is the STACK.The stack is a piece of memory that works like a tube with only oneopen end: YOU CAN ONLY GET OUT WHAT YOU PUT IN LAST!!The only thing you can put in are 16 bit values. Since one bit is used asa sign bit, that leaves 15 bits too define the value: 2^15=32768This means you can insert INTEGERS in the RANGE -32767 to 32767.(32 bit numbers and floats are also possible, but use special commands)The stack is used for all calculations, that's why it is 'post-fixed'.Each value (or address) that is typed or present in a program, isput on the stack. Standard commands or self defined 'words' alwaysuse values that have to be ALREADY ON THE STACK. They take them off, andinstead put a result (if there is any) on the stack.For example: 	2 3 + .		This puts 2 on stack, 3 on stack, runs the standard word "+", whichalways takes and adds the two values on the top of the stack and leaves theresult on the stack. The command "." takes the value of the top of the stackand puts it onto the screen, so the value 5 appears on screen as a result of these instructions.It could have been left on the stack to perform another calculation:			2 3 + 6 - .		puts the value -1 on the screen		or	2 3 6 + - .		puts the value -7 on the screen!The stack is quite 'deep', but not infinite, so ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT WHAT GOES ON THE STACK, GOES OFF AGAIN (SOON OR LATE)!If this is not done, it will result in errors (stack overflow or underflow) and stop the program, especially when using loops!***************************************************************************2 VARIABLESOf course not everything is stored 'on the stack'. But also storing valuesin normal memory addresses is done via the stack.			variable ADThis command allocates space in the memory for a value on the address AD.AD is now the same as the address that can be used. It IS that address, a value, just like 6770 is! So just type:			AD .to check which address. Not that that's interesting, because that value is just the address of a piece of memory we can use!The commands @ and ! can be used to read and write on that address:			AD			puts the allocated address on stack 			AD @		puts the content of address AD on stack			AD @ .		puts the content of address AD on screen			100 AD !		puts 100 in address AD			AD 100 !		puts address AD in address 100: ILLEGAL!NB: SO "@" MEANS READ AND "!" MEANS WRITE!***************************************************************************3 ARRAYSSometimes it is necessary to store or read a whole list of values.This could be done by defining just as many variables, but it is usually done using an array.			variable AD allot 10This command allocates not just room for one value, but for FIVE values.NB: ONLY EVEN ADDRESSES ARE USED e.g.:			AD 2 + @		puts the content of address AD+2 on stack			10 AD 10 + !	puts 10 in address AD+10			10 10 AD + !	(idem!)***************************************************************************4 LOOPSA loop can be used to fill an array with data:			10 0 Do   200 I 2 * +   AD I + !    2 +LoopThis creates a loop between "Do" and "Loop". It 'loops' 5 times: 0 to 10, step 2"I" puts the 'index' of the loop on the stack (0 2 4 6 8)It stores (!) 200+2*I in the address AD+0 AD+2 AD+4 AD+6 and AD+8.So afterwards:	AD @		puts 200 on stack			AD 2 + @		puts 204 on stack					AD 4 + @ 		puts 208 on stack			AD 6 + @ 		puts 212 on stack			AD 8 + @ 		puts 216 on stackThe line:		Begin ... AgainCreates an endless loop between "Begin" and "Again".***************************************************************************5 CONDITIONAL LOOPS AND BRANCHINGNot all loops are defined or endless. Sometimes something has to bedone UNTIL e.g. a key is pressed. Or only IF a key is pressed, or a certainvalue is reached!Conditions can be tested and the result will set a 'FLAG' to true or false.			2 3 =		This will set the FLAG to false			2 3 * 6 =		This will set the FLAG to trueAFTER the FLAG is set it can be used to break or maintain a loop, or toexecute a conditional set of instructions:			(flag) if ... then		... is executed if the flag is true			(flag) if . else ... then	... is executed if the flag is false			BEGIN É  (flag) WHILE É REPEAT			BEGIN É  (flag) UNTIL***************************************************************************6 USING and CREATING "WORDS": PROGRAMMINGThese are frequently used STANDARD COMMANDS or "WORDS":: WORD ... ;		compile ... as new subroutine called WORD			/ * - + 		divide, times, minus, sum=   <   >		checks relation upper two stack values, sets flag .			displays top value on stack (removes value off stack)." text"		display textstring (start with space!)DUP			duplicates stack (to evoid destruction)DROP		destroy top of stackSWAP		exchange upper two stck valuesVARIABLE X	claims use of memory address to be called X4 ALLOT		claims 4 more bytes beyond X (used after variable ...)2 X !			puts 2 in address X2 X +!		adds 2 to the content of address X8 X 2 + !		puts 8 in address X+2 (array)X @			puts content of address X on stackKEY			puts ASCII code of typed key on stack (waits)PAGE		clears screen, cursor to upper left@MOUSE		puts mouse coordinates on stack?BUTTON		sets flag true if mousebutton clicked?TERMINAL	sets flag true if key pressedCR			carriage return!PEN			moves cursor/drawing pen to 2 upper stack coordinates@PEN		puts pen coordinates on stack-TO			draws line to 2 upper stack coordinates13 emit		display character 13 of ASCII tableBEEP			sounds default beepQUIT		exits program, return to interpreterS 10 EXPECT	stores 10 characters starting at address SS 10 TYPE		displays 10 characters starting at address SPMODE		uses stack to set drawing mode--> Drive:Path:Name	loads and interprets Forth file (see example below)NB (conditional) loops and branches are described in ¤4 and 5!NB Check the Glossary and download the original Pocket Forth-package for more info on Forth, Apple Events and the toolbox.Defined in Extended.4th:I					puts index of loop on stack (J if nested)-9 DABS				returns absolute value (puts 9 on stack)RANDOMIZE			randomize using the clock5 RANDOM			puts random integer between 0-4 on stackcreate "name" , " string"	puts string on address "name" (WINDOW)"name" WTITLE			uses "string" as window title200 100 WSIZE			sizes window 200x100 pixelsFCOLOR				use: 	white, black, blue, green, red, cyan, BCOLOR				magenta, yellow  e.g. "blue FCOLOR"					F=foreground(pen)  B=background(window)!FONT 				( n -- )	set font!FSIZE 				( n -- ) 	set size!FACE 				( face -- )	set style!FMODE 				( mode -- ) set modeSYSFONT 				use System fontMONACO9 			use Normal fontNEW WORDS can be CREATED by using ":" and ";"			: TEST ." test" ;This instruction compiles a subroutine TEST, that can be called from theinterpreter, or be used in another subroutine e.g.:			: GO Do TEST ?terminal Until ;GO displays "test test test ....." until a key is pressed.NB: 	-Forth is not case sensitive: DO is the same as Do or do.	-a SPACE or TAB has to divide ALL instructions (remember that	  also values and things like "+" or ":" and ";" are instructions!)We will now take a look at LIFE to demonstrate how an application is made:This is my file "Documenten:Development:Forth:Life.4th"(Comment is found after "\ ")\ ****** LIFE  in  FORTH  by  MERVYN@xs4all.nl *******--> Documenten:Development:Forth:Extended.4th\ this adds the new words in Extended.4th to the language!\ this file can be altered to create your own customized Forth versionvariable FIELD 2600 allot  variable FIELD2 2600 allot  \ this allocates twee arrays for 1300 (remember?) integersvariable PLACE variable PL variable X variable Y  create "TITLE" ," Life"  \ this puts the string Life on the address "TITLE": COPYFIELDS  2600 0 Do  I FIELD2 + @  I FIELD + !  2 +Loop ;\ a new word that copies the changed array FIELD2 to FIELD: SETUP Begin  2480 80 Do  80 0 Do   	I J + FIELD2 + @  1 = if I 5 * J 80 - 6 / !PEN ." *" then 	\ this displays the array as a 2d field of stars (if field=1)	\ I is the second (nested) index, J the first!	2 +Loop  80 +Loop  key 	dup 28 = if PLACE @ 2 - PLACE ! then	dup 29 = if PLACE @ 2 + PLACE ! then	dup 30 = if PLACE @ 80 - PLACE ! then	dup 31 = if PLACE @ 80 + PLACE ! then	dup 32 = if  1 FIELD2 PLACE @ + !  then	\ this uses the cursor keys and space to set up a field	       13 = Until ;: INIT  FIELD2 2600 0 fill  COPYFIELDS 1400 PLACE !  	BLACK bcolor WHITE fcolor 500 310 wsize  "TITLE" wtitle page 	\ sets colors and sizes and names window, clears screen	CR CR 	."

See change to "variable", below.: ( -- ) say: "colon" <standard> "Colon" creates a new word, called a colon definition.  The token following "colon" is the name of the new word.  Non-immediate words following the name are compiled into the definition until a "semi-colon" is reached.; ( -- ) say: "semi-colon" <standard>  "Semi-colon" ends a colon definition and compiles a machine language return instruction. "Semi-colon" is immediate.;AE ( -- ) say "semi-a-e  Use "semi-a-e" to end an Apple Event definition. Pocket Forth's registers are saved and the calling registers are restored.

If _Gestalt does not exist or if it exits with an error, a false flag (that is, a zero) is left on the stack.  If the call is successful, a true flag (-1) is left on the stack on top of the double number result.  Use "question-gestalt" to test computer in use.?STACK ( ? -- ) say: "question-stack"   Print a warning, '*?', if stack underflow has occurred.?TERMINAL ( -- flag ) say: "question-terminal" <standard> Leave a true flag if a key has been pressed.

The address must be even.@MOUSE  ( -- h v ) say: "at-mouse"   Get the coordinates of the mouse pointer.@PEN ( -- h v ) say: "at-pen"   Get the coordinates of the graphics pen pen.A>R ( addr -- : -- dabs.addr ) say: "a-to-are"   Convert an address to absolute, and put it on the return stack. This word is used for system trap setup.  Use only within a colon definition.ABORT ( -- )  <standard>   Stop execution, print a warning, '?' and return to the interpreter loop.AE: ( d.type d.class -- ) say: "a-e-colon"  "Ae:" begins the definition of an Apple Event handler. D.type and d.class are the type and class signatures of the event to be handled. Follow the definition with ";ae".AGAIN  while compiling: ( addr -- )  while executing: ( -- )  <standard>   Used to compile an unconditional branch to a relative address left by "begin".  (see "begin" and "back")  "Again" is an immediate word.ALLOT ( n -- )  <standard>   Allocate and enclose n bytes in the dictionary.  If n is odd, n+1 bytes will be allocated.  The value of the bytes is undefined at compile time.AND ( n1 n2 -- n1ANDn2 )  <standard>   Leave the result of n1 AND n2 on the stack.  The value is computed bitwise.BACK while compiling: ( addr -- )  no execution behavior  <standard>   Compiles the difference between the current compilation address and the address on the stack.  "Back" is used by "again", "repeat" and "until". (also see "begin" and "while")BASE ( -- addr )  <standard>   "Base" leaves the address of a variable containing the current number base.BEEP ( -- )   Causes the speaker to beep at the current volume.BEGIN ( -- )  <standard>   "Begin" starts a conditional or unconditional loop in the following manner:          BEGIN É ( -- flag ) WHILE É REPEAT,          BEGIN É ( -- flag ) UNTIL and             BEGIN É AGAIN        "Begin" is an immediate word and is used within a colon definition.  (see "while", "again", "repeat" and "until")BYE ( -- )  "Bye" sets a variable (194 +md) that causes Pocket Forth to quit on the next trip through the event loop.C! ( c addr -- ) say: "sea-store"  <standard>   Store the 8 bit value at the relative address (even or odd).C@ ( addr -- c ) say: "sea-at"  <standard>   Retrieve the 8 bit value found at the address (even or odd) to the stack.CBLK ( -- addr ) say: "sea-bee-el-kay"   Returns a relative address which contains a byte value.  If the value is 128, then the interpreter looks for input from the keyboard.  A zero value causes text to be interpreted from the file stack.CMOVE ( addr1 addr2 n -- ) say: "sea-move" <standard>   Moves n bytes from addr1 to addr2.COMPILE ( addr -- )   "Compile" writes a subroutine call to the relative address on the stack into the dictionary.

The first byte must contain the length of the string.VARIABLE compiling: ( -- ) executing: ( -- addr )  <standard>   "Variable" creates a word from the next word in the input stream, and reserves one cell (two bytes) of data.  When the new word is executed, it leaves the relative address of the data cell on the stack.
